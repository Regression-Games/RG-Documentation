# Introduction

Regression Games uses Git (and more specifically GitHub) as the backbone to manage and version your bots. 
This means that we support a wide variety of ways for players to program their bots, whether it be locally or
in online IDEs such as Replit and Codespaces. This document goes over how to develop your bots.

For newer players, we recommend using Codespaces or Replit for development, so that you don't need to manage
your own development environment.

## Finding your bot code

During onboarding, you should have created a bot, backed by a GitHub repo. If you have not done this yet,
make sure to create a new bot within the [Bot Manager page](/bots).

If you are signed in and have created a bot, you can see your bot here (or in the [Bot Manager page](/bots)).

Click on the GitHub link directly below your bot to see your code. The green "Code" button on GitHub will give
you access to the URLs and features to clone your repository to your local machine, or edit yor code on Codespaces.


## Developing on Codespaces

Codespaces is the fastest way to get up and running with bot development. Codespaces is the cloud IDE (based on VSCode)
from GitHub and Microsoft that allows you to edit your GitHub repositories with just a few clicks.

To get started, navigate to the GitHub page for your code. Then select the "Code" button, and click "Codespaces"

## Developing Locally

To develop bots for Regression Games locally, you will need an IDE or text editor (such as VSCode, IntelliJ,
etc...), as well as git. Follow the links for each of those items if you need to install those tools.

Once you have an editor of choice and git installed, you can
