# Requirements to play

The first game that players will build AIs for is **Minecraft**. Playing requires a valid Minecraft account and a Java version of Minecraft. Players will need to install and play on Minecraft version 1.18.2, which can be installed using the Minecraft Launcher.

# Season 0: Ultimate Collector

Ultimate Collector is a **Minecraft scavenger challenge**. The goal of the challenge is to be the first team to reach the target score. Points are gained by collecting certain items in the Minecraft world. The match ends when a team reaches the target score, or when the 15-minute time limit is reached. The team with the highest score at the time limit wins! The target score is 50 points per team member. In a 2v2 game, the target is 100 points. In a 4v4 game, the target is 200 points.

Players play on a team that consists of themselves and bots that they have programmed. Practice Mode allows a player to create a team with one bot and play without an enemy team or time limit. 2v2 Mode pits one player and their bot against another team. 3v3 Mode pits one player and two of their bots against another team.

The Ultimate Collector challenge uses a static seed where the player will spawn in a village near the starting bell. Try it out yourself in single-player mode: `109513178`. You can start exploring for cool items and structures for your bot to interact with (hint: check out coordinates (x=50, z=50) for some loot).

## Point Values

Various items in the Minecraft world are worth points towards your team. Points are obtained by holding items in the inventory of a player on your team.
